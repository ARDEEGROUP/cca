  "FARHAD HUSSAIN": {
    name: "FARHAD HUSSAIN",
    title: "Born 1975, Kolkata, West Bengal, India",
    image: "images/farhad.jpg",
    bio: [
    "Farhad Hussain grew up in Kolkata, surrounded by the textures of middle-class Indian life—crowded markets, family squabbles, festival colors, and the quiet comedy of everyday existence. Trained at the Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan, he developed a style that is both satirical and affectionate, drawing heavily from the visual chaos of Indian urbanity. His paintings burst with color and caricature, featuring characters frozen in awkward, intimate, or absurd moments—caught mid-gesture, as if in the middle of a soap opera that never ends. Behind the humor, however, lies a deeper reflection on social roles, domesticity, and human contradiction. Influenced by miniature painting, pop culture, and textile design, Farhad’s works blur boundaries between high and low, tradition and trend. He paints not to escape the world, but to hold a mirror to it—with a wink, a laugh, and a touch of melancholy. For Farhad, art is a theatre of observation—where nothing is too ordinary to be transformed into story.",
    "1. This vibrant painting by Farhad Hussain depicts a joyful, stylized family scene rendered in his signature pop-art-inspired aesthetic. Set against a playful backdrop with bold numbers and a checkered floor, four figures—adults and children—interact with exaggerated expressions and dynamic poses, centered around a seesaw and a colorful beach ball. A cheerful yellow dog peeks from the corner, adding warmth and whimsy. With flat colors, graphic outlines, and surreal proportions, the work captures the humor, energy, and theatricality of everyday domestic life.",

  "INDRAPRAMIT ROY": {
    name: "INDRAPRAMIT ROY",
    title: "Born in 1964 in Kolkata, West Bengal, India",
    image: "images/indra.jpg",
    bio: [
      "Indrapramit Roy grew up in Shantiniketan, where poetry, art, and nature flowed together seamlessly. With a poet father and an early life immersed in quiet observation, he learned to see the world through layers—of memory, atmosphere, and meaning. His paintings often unfold like poems: slow, meditative, and filled with half-remembered places. Over the years, his canvases have become spaces of quiet contemplation—where fragments of architecture, windows, landscapes, and traces of memory drift in and out, like thoughts held just below the surface.",
      "His practice resists urgency. It is deeply patient, often drawing from poetry, weather, literature, and silence. In his layered textures and muted palettes, there is always a sense of distance—of something remembered, or half-seen. Indrapramit does not try to narrate, but rather evoke—a gentle invitation to dwell in the in-between.",
      "1. A body lies twisted and motionless under a thicket of storm-battered trees. This deeply emotive drawing confronts the viewer with the vulnerability of the human form in the face of both natural and social collapse. While the jungle-like environment suggests shelter, it also entangles the lifeless figure, blurring the boundary between refuge and ruin. The artist’s nuanced use of light and shadow allows the eye to wander slowly—tracing the curve of a limp foot, the tension in the limbs, the darkened sky. A quiet sorrow lingers in the atmosphere, speaking of erasure, displacement, and forgotten lives caught in disaster's wake.",
      "2. This haunting monochromatic composition captures a post-conflict scene—charred buildings, a flaming jeep, and a sky thick with smoke. Through urgent and expressive charcoal strokes, the artist evokes a moment of collapse, disarray, and destruction. The tilted telephone poles and crumpled structures underscore a sense of disorder, while the flames licking through the debris offer both a visual and emotional heat. It is not merely a documentation of violence—it’s a visceral reckoning with loss, chaos, and the silence that follows an eruption. The absence of human figures emphasizes the void, a city emptied by its own undoing."

   "S. HARSHAVARDHANA": {
    name: "S. HARSHAVARDHANA",
    title: "Born in 1958 in Delhi, India",
    image: "images/harsh.jpeg",
    bio: [
      "S. Harshavardhana never set out to be an artist in the conventional sense. Trained as a medical professional, his early years were spent studying the structures of the human body—quietly observing the systems that hold life together. But somewhere in the space between science and solitude, he found his way to art. What began as an internal search became a lifelong practice of abstraction.",
      "Born in New Delhi in 1958 to the celebrated modernist J. Swaminathan, Harshavardhana inherited not just a lineage, but a sense of inquiry. Yet his work carves its own path—anchored in the rigor of discipline and the lyricism of line. His forms do not narrate; they pulse. Over the years, he developed a visual language that bridges the ancient and the modern, the rational and the intuitive.",
      "Minimal yet deeply charged, his canvases often feature symbolic signs and mark-making that evoke a meditative state. There is no clutter—only precision, space, and rhythm. For Harshavardhana, abstraction is not a style but a way of seeing, a way of being. It is where silence speaks loudest.",
      "1. In this minimalist yet evocative composition, S. Harshavardhana layers texture and geometry to create a meditative visual field. A large rectangular form dominates the canvas—divided diagonally into dark green and textured white segments, each bearing the imprint of repeated marks and subtle erasures. The background, a muted blue-grey, enhances the stillness of the image, allowing the eye to settle into the work’s quiet rhythm.",
      "The balance between organic textures and precise shapes is central to Harshavardhana’s language of abstraction. Here, the visual weight shifts gently from solidity to translucence, echoing themes of duality, containment, and silent energy. The fine linear details on the side and the delicate overlay of strokes on the surface offer a sense of coded meaning—as though the painting holds a script not meant to be read, but felt. ",
