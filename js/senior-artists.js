    name: "FARHAD HUSSAIN",
    title: "Born 1975, Kolkata, West Bengal, India",

    bio: [
    "Farhad Hussain grew up in Kolkata, surrounded by the textures of middle-class Indian life—crowded markets, family squabbles, festival colors, and the quiet comedy of everyday existence. Trained at the Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan, he developed a style that is both satirical and affectionate, drawing heavily from the visual chaos of Indian urbanity. His paintings burst with color and caricature, featuring characters frozen in awkward, intimate, or absurd moments—caught mid-gesture, as if in the middle of a soap opera that never ends. Behind the humor, however, lies a deeper reflection on social roles, domesticity, and human contradiction. Influenced by miniature painting, pop culture, and textile design, Farhad’s works blur boundaries between high and low, tradition and trend. He paints not to escape the world, but to hold a mirror to it—with a wink, a laugh, and a touch of melancholy. For Farhad, art is a theatre of observation—where nothing is too ordinary to be transformed into story.",
    "1. This vibrant painting by Farhad Hussain depicts a joyful, stylized family scene rendered in his signature pop-art-inspired aesthetic. Set against a playful backdrop with bold numbers and a checkered floor, four figures—adults and children—interact with exaggerated expressions and dynamic poses, centered around a seesaw and a colorful beach ball. A cheerful yellow dog peeks from the corner, adding warmth and whimsy. With flat colors, graphic outlines, and surreal proportions, the work captures the humor, energy, and theatricality of everyday domestic life.",

  "INDRAPERMIT ROY": {
    name: "INDRAPERMIT ROY",
    title: "Born in 1964 in Kolkata, West Bengal, India",
    image: "images/roy.jpg",
    bio: [
      "Indrapramit Roy grew up in Shantiniketan, where poetry, art, and nature flowed together seamlessly. With a poet father and an early life immersed in quiet observation, he learned to see the world through layers—of memory, atmosphere, and meaning. His paintings often unfold like poems: slow, meditative, and filled with half-remembered places. Over the years, his canvases have become spaces of quiet contemplation—where fragments of architecture, windows, landscapes, and traces of memory drift in and out, like thoughts held just below the surface.",
      "His practice resists urgency. It is deeply patient, often drawing from poetry, weather, literature, and silence. In his layered textures and muted palettes, there is always a sense of distance—of something remembered, or half-seen. Indrapramit does not try to narrate, but rather evoke—a gentle invitation to dwell in the in-between.",
      "1. A body lies twisted and motionless under a thicket of storm-battered trees. This deeply emotive drawing confronts the viewer with the vulnerability of the human form in the face of both natural and social collapse. While the jungle-like environment suggests shelter, it also entangles the lifeless figure, blurring the boundary between refuge and ruin. The artist’s nuanced use of light and shadow allows the eye to wander slowly—tracing the curve of a limp foot, the tension in the limbs, the darkened sky. A quiet sorrow lingers in the atmosphere, speaking of erasure, displacement, and forgotten lives caught in disaster's wake.",
      "2. This haunting monochromatic composition captures a post-conflict scene—charred buildings, a flaming jeep, and a sky thick with smoke. Through urgent and expressive charcoal strokes, the artist evokes a moment of collapse, disarray, and destruction. The tilted telephone poles and crumpled structures underscore a sense of disorder, while the flames licking through the debris offer both a visual and emotional heat. It is not merely a documentation of violence—it’s a visceral reckoning with loss, chaos, and the silence that follows an eruption. The absence of human figures emphasizes the void, a city emptied by its own undoing."
