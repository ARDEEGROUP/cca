    bio: [
    "Yamini Mohan’s journey as an artist began not in a studio, but in the quiet, intimate corners of her childhood home in Delhi—watching her mother braid hair, her grandmother embroider faded saris, her sister sketching by the window. It was in these domestic rituals, soft gestures of care and repetition, that Yamini first began to understand the language of form and emotion. Drawing became her way of remembering, of holding onto the stories that often go unspoken. Over time, her lines grew bolder, her forms more abstract—but at their core, they remained rooted in the human experience. Yamini’s work reflects a deep, intuitive engagement with memory, family, and the psychological weight of relationships. Her figures—often clustered, entwined, or resting into each other—speak of closeness, dependency, and the invisible threads that bind people together.Her works are not declarations, but invitations—to pause, to look closer, and to feel what often goes unnoticed.",

    "1. This evocative drawing features four closely bound human figures—a mother surrounded by children—enfolded in a fluid web of dark lines. The artist uses gentle tones of brown and black to highlight intimacy and containment. The overlapping limbs and mirrored gazes suggest a shared emotional space, capturing the resilience and tenderness embedded within familial structures. There is a quiet strength in the way the figures are held together, both physically and symbolically, echoing themes of protection and generational continuity.",
    
    "2. Rendered in sweeping monochrome strokes, this composition presents an entangled group of figures in a deeply emotional embrace. The drawing leans toward abstraction, yet reveals a raw vulnerability in the way bodies are curled into one another. Lines loop and fold, creating a cocoon-like enclosure that blurs the boundary between individual and collective self. The work speaks of grief, comfort, and interdependence—perhaps evoking a moment of mourning or spiritual reunion. The absence of color heightens the emotional gravity and meditative quality of the piece.",

    name: "ANURAG PAUL",
    title: "Born 1999, kolkata, India",
    image: "images/paul.jpeg",
    bio: [
    "Anurag Paul is a Kolkata-based artist, his practice explores the poetic potential of everyday objects, transforming the ordinary into layered visual narratives that evoke both personal and collective memory. Drawing from observation, literary methods, repetition, and mnemonic devices, Anurag invites viewers to find their own meanings within his intricately detailed works—often punctuated by cleverly crafted titles that blend humour with layered meaning.",

    "1. This intricate composition by Anurag Paul is a tapestry of emotion, memory, and collective identity. Rendered in rich earth tones and layered with dense patterning, the work depicts a group of abstracted human figures—each uniquely adorned with motifs that evoke ritual, architecture, scars, maps, and inner symbols. The composition pulses with rhythmic geometry: spirals, checks, stars, and anatomical outlines become vessels of layered meaning.",
    
    "At its core, the artwork becomes a visual archive of interwoven lives—silent witnesses to migration, transformation, and belonging. It is a celebration of complexity, drawing the viewer into a hypnotic field of textures and voices, where every line tells a story, and every body is a myth.",
