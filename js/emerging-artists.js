    bio: [
    "Farhad Hussain grew up in Kolkata, surrounded by the textures of middle-class Indian life—crowded markets, family squabbles, festival colors, and the quiet comedy of everyday existence. Trained at the Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan, he developed a style that is both satirical and affectionate, drawing heavily from the visual chaos of Indian urbanity. His paintings burst with color and caricature, featuring characters frozen in awkward, intimate, or absurd moments—caught mid-gesture, as if in the middle of a soap opera that never ends. Behind the humor, however, lies a deeper reflection on social roles, domesticity, and human contradiction. Influenced by miniature painting, pop culture, and textile design, Farhad’s works blur boundaries between high and low, tradition and trend. He paints not to escape the world, but to hold a mirror to it—with a wink, a laugh, and a touch of melancholy. For Farhad, art is a theatre of observation—where nothing is too ordinary to be transformed into story.",
    "1. This vibrant painting by Farhad Hussain depicts a joyful, stylized family scene rendered in his signature pop-art-inspired aesthetic. Set against a playful backdrop with bold numbers and a checkered floor, four figures—adults and children—interact with exaggerated expressions and dynamic poses, centered around a seesaw and a colorful beach ball. A cheerful yellow dog peeks from the corner, adding warmth and whimsy. With flat colors, graphic outlines, and surreal proportions, the work captures the humor, energy, and theatricality of everyday domestic life.",
