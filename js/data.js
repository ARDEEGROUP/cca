    bio: ["Born into the Pardhan Gond community, Jangarh Singh Shyam's life changed when he was discovered by the artist J. Swaminathan. From humble beginnings, he became the torchbearer of a whole new genre of contemporary tribal art, now known as “Jangarh Kalam.” His vivid imagination was rooted in forest stories, spirits, and animals of his homeland, but his technique—pointillist, layered, and experimental—was entirely his own. He gave form to his inner world with mythic resonance and emotional depth, inspiring generations of artists in and beyond his community.",
    "1. This painting by Jangarh Singh Shyam depicts a stylized animal, possibly a boar or a wild pig, rendered in his distinctive Pardhan Gond art style. The creature is filled with intricate patterns of small, concentric, arc-shaped dots in shades of red, blue, and white, creating a mesmerizing texture and a sense of movement within its form. A single, prominent eye stands out against the patterned body, and small red tusks are visible near its snout, indicating its animalistic nature. The artwork is set against a plain, light background, allowing the vibrant colors and detailed patterns of the animal to be the sole focus.  ",

   " Jodhaiya Bai’s hands carried decades of forest life—gathering, healing, and sustaining. It wasn’t until her 70s that she began painting, transferring the spiritual knowledge of the Baiga people onto canvas. Her art is visceral and intuitive, often filled with spirit-beings, sacred forests, and mysterious creatures.

With her distinctive palette and rhythmic detailing, Jodhaiya Bai constructs a visual language that speaks to ritual, nature, and deep reverence for the elements that sustain Baiga life.",

    "3. Jodhaiya Bai Baiga’s dynamic painting portrays a forest scene alive with movement—animals scatter as flames encroach, possibly referencing forest fires or human-induced ecological disruption. A central tree becomes a sanctuary for birds and beasts, while tigers, porcupines, and deer flee the burning earth. With childlike clarity and symbolic force, the artist warns of imbalance in the natural world. Her art, while folkloric in style, carries an urgent contemporary message about the fragile harmony between humans, animals, and forests.",

The background is a warm orange-brown, and a blue strip beneath the figure suggests water or ground. Small details, like birds on the trees, add to the natural setting.

One figure, for instance, might be holding an object or performing a gesture, while another stands beside a pole or a vertical structure. The artist's signature Gond style is visible in the elongated forms and the narrative quality of the scene, suggesting a slice oflife, a ritual, or a storytelling element from his cultural context.

It portrays a scene involving figures, water, and perhaps themes of sustenance or ritual. A prominent stylized vessel, from which water appears to be flowing downwards into a larger body of water or a container, is a central element. Human figures are integrated into the scene; one figure on the right seems to be tending to or participating in the activity, perhaps holding an object or a lamp. The use of bold, flat colors – including shades of blue, yellow, red, and green – along with the characteristic Gond style of outlining and infilling with patterns, gives the artwork a powerful visual impact. Small, abstract shapes resembling leaves or elements of nature are scattered throughout the background, adding to the rich texture and symbolic depth of the piece.",

The negative space is skillfully utilized to define shapes, and the overall effect is one of delicate lace-like patterns.

    "3. This black-on-white painting captures a whimsical rural moment, where human and animal figures interact in harmony. Rendered in bold silhouettes, cows, birds, and two joyful human figures form a circular composition, evoking unity and mutual dependence. Lado Bai’s minimal, almost stencil-like style retains a raw vitality, speaking of innocence, rhythm, and the everyday bonds shared between people and animals in tribal life.",

Tigers, porcupines, birds, and deer filled his canvases with quiet vitality, while his illustrations of goddesses—such as Bangari Devi, Bahri Batorandevi, and Chausat Joghan—brought divine feminine power into visual form in the book Gond Devlok, a collaboration with Dr. Dharmendra Pare.Narmada Prasad Tekam’s legacy lives on through the forests he painted, the deities he invoked, and the sand where it all began",
