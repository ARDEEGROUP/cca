Her art is visceral and intuitive, often filled with spirit-beings, sacred forests, and mysterious creatures.

But his journey was uniquely his own—working as a sign painter, rickshaw puller, and night watchman before fully entering the art world. His works are layered with social commentary, family lore, and urban experiences, told through the symbols and animals of his Gond heritage. For Venkat, painting is an act of survival and rebellion—an assertion of identity in a shifting world.",
    "1. In this intricate composition, Venkat Raman Singh Shyam brings together a multitude of figures in dynamic interaction, illustrating a community in motion. The painting teems with activity—human and animal forms, rituals, and everyday gestures—interwoven into a dense, rhythmic narrative. Echoing the visual vocabulary of the Gond tradition, each figure is stylized with patterned textures and fluid lines, capturing movement and interdependence. The central motif appears to be a journey—perhaps migratory or mythological—framing the painting as a layered story of displacement, cultural transmission, and resilience. The red and green border framing the scene subtly references traditional textiles or scrolls, suggesting a continuity of storytelling forms.",
    "2.This bold composition by Venkat Raman Singh Shyam reimagines mythological figures in strikingly contemporary ways. The characters, rendered with exaggerated bodily proportions and expressive features, appear in a scene charged with symbolism—perhaps invoking a reinterpretation of origin myths or cosmic dramas. The presence of the Indian flag and a totemic pole to the right hints at the collision between indigenous identities and modern national narratives. Each figure's detailing—from headdresses to textured skin—is rendered with precision, echoing the Gond aesthetic while allowing space for subversion and satire. The artist’s use of color—particularly the deep reds and blues—enhances the theatricality and emotional intensity of the scene, inviting viewers to reconsider the roles of tradition, power, and mythology in contemporary life.",

Within and around the tree's structure, various animals and hidden figures are intricately woven into the design, a hallmark of Gond art's connection to nature and its creatures. The negative space is skillfully utilized to define shapes, and the overall effect is one of delicate lace-like patterns.

For Lado Bai, every painting is an offering to her ancestors and her land.",

    "1. This artwork by Lado Bai is a collection of twelve individual panels, each rendered in stark black and white, characteristic of Bhil painting. The panels depict a variety of stylized nature and animal motifs, reflecting tribal folklore and the natural world. Common themes include trees with dense foliage, various animals like horses, deer, and birds, and sometimes human figures integrated into the environment. The compositions are generally vertical, with forms often elongated or stacked, and filled with intricate patterns or solid black shapes. The overall impression is one of rhythmic repetition and symbolic storytelling through simplified yet evocative imagery.",

His palette came from the forest—leaves, flowers, earth—and his subjects were the beings around him: humans, animals, birds, and gods. Over time, his motifs evolved, but he remained faithful to the symbols of the Gond worldview. Tigers, porcupines, birds, and deer filled his canvases with quiet vitality, while his illustrations of goddesses—such as Bangari Devi, Bahri Batorandevi, and Chausat Joghan—brought divine feminine power into visual form in the book Gond Devlok, a collaboration with Dr. Dharmendra Pare.Narmada Prasad Tekam’s legacy lives on through the forests he painted, the deities he invoked, and the sand where it all began",
