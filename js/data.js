    image: "images/jangarh.jpg",
    bio: ["Born into the Pardhan Gond community, Jangarh Singh Shyam's life changed when he was discovered by the artist J. Swaminathan. From humble beginnings, he became the torchbearer of a whole new genre of contemporary tribal art, now known as “Jangarh Kalam.” His vivid imagination was rooted in forest stories, spirits, and animals of his homeland, but his technique—pointillist, layered, and experimental—was entirely his own. He gave form to his inner world with mythic resonance and emotional depth, inspiring generations of artists in and beyond his community.",

  title: "Circa 1930s, Lorha Village, Dindori District, Madhya Pradesh, India",
  image: "images/jodtwo.jpg",
  bio: [
   " Jodhaiya Bai’s hands carried decades of forest life—gathering, healing, and sustaining. It wasn’t until her 70s that she began painting, transferring the spiritual knowledge of the Baiga people onto canvas. Her art is visceral and intuitive, often filled with spirit-beings, sacred forests, and mysterious creatures. Each painting is a reflection of the world she knows deeply: a world of ecological harmony, ancestral whispers, and feminine strength. Her late start is not a limitation but a testament to lifelong wisdom finding its voice.",


   "1. In this powerful composition, Jodhaiya Bai Baiga depicts a vivid, divine tableau featuring tribal representations of deities adorned with jewelry, animal motifs, and sacred objects. Rendered in flat, bold colors with striking geometry, the figures radiate strength and presence. The central blue figure, possibly a forest deity, is flanked by a red-hued companion and a smaller worshipper. The snake and bow, recurring elements in her work, reinforce themes of power, protection, and ancest",

    "2. This artwork offers a spiritual yet grounded vision of a forest god, seated in a meditative posture, surrounded by symbols of fertility, protection, and natural harmony. A Shivlinga, sun motif, snake, and sacred flags appear alongside a lush tree teeming with birds. The figure’s expression is serene yet commanding. With her distinctive palette and rhythmic detailing, Jodhaiya Bai constructs a visual language that speaks to ritual, nature, and deep reverence for the elements that sustain Baiga life.",

    "3. Jodhaiya Bai Baiga’s dynamic painting portrays a forest scene alive with movement—animals scatter as flames encroach, possibly referencing forest fires or human-induced ecological disruption. A central tree becomes a sanctuary for birds and beasts, while tigers, porcupines, and deer flee the burning earth. With childlike clarity and symbolic force, the artist warns of imbalance in the natural world. Her art, while folkloric in style, carries an urgent contemporary message about the fragile harmony between humans, animals, and forests.",

But instead of staying in the past, he uses Warli’s minimalist lines to comment on modern life—urbanization, migration, and change.

      "Young and passionate, Dhavat Singh grew up watching his elders paint and perform rituals. He took that visual language and made it his own, infusing it with bold colors and new forms. His art reflects a changing tribal world—still connected to the forest, but also facing roads, mobile phones, and outside influences. With each canvas, Dhavat celebrates the vitality of Bhil identity in a time of transformation.",

Using fine stippling and textured strokes, Dhavat Singh stylizes the tiger’s stripes and form with remarkable elegance. The tiger here is not just an animal but a powerful symbol—of pride, fear, and balance in tribal lore. The minimalism of the composition emphasizes the creature’s strength and mystique, transforming it into an emblem of the forest’s spirit and presence.",

At its center sits a stylized tiger with bold, concentric stripes, symbolizing both danger and guardianship. The tree becomes a living world with homes nestled in its branches and everyday scenes unfolding—women carrying pots, animals feeding, and children playing. Through fine dot-work and rhythmic line patterns, Singh captures the pulse of rural life and the harmonious interdependence between nature and community.",

    bio: "Santosh Kumar Das grew up in the heart of Mithila, surrounded by the intricate ritual paintings of his mother and the stories that women told through their art. But as a young man, he was equally drawn to the world beyond—books, politics, poetry, and ink. In his hands, the Madhubani tradition evolved, not abandoned but sharpened. He replaced color with stark black ink, reimagining the form to express protest, devotion, and inner reflection. His works carry the grace of the old and the urgency of the now—Sita weeps, Gandhi meditates, and villages burn under the same fine lines. For Das, painting is both memory and mirror—a way to stay rooted while looking the world in the eye.",

Born into a community where myths were not just stories but lived truths, he painted with reverence—each dot a prayer, each animal a spirit guide. Pema did not learn art in a classroom; he absorbed it through rituals, songs, and the changing skies of Madhya Pradesh. His canvases, rich with color and memory, spoke of gods, seasons, harvests, and the quiet dignity of tribal life. Though he is no longer with us, his work lives on as a testament to a world seen through ancestral eyes and painted with profound tenderness. In every dot and curve, Pema Fatya reminds us of the beauty of remembering.",

    image: "images/narmada.jpeg",
    bio:[
      "The late Narmada Prasad Tekam was a gifted Gond artist whose art grew directly from the soil and spirit of his homeland. As a young boy herding cattle by the banks of the River Singni, he discovered his first canvas in the sand. Lying down to trace his own body with a stick, he began what would become a lifelong journey of image-making—one rooted in instinct, nature, and tradition.In his early years, Narmada painted on the walls of his home using black and yellow clay. His palette came from the forest—leaves, flowers, earth—and his subjects were the beings around him: humans, animals, birds, and gods. Over time, his motifs evolved, but he remained faithful to the symbols of the Gond worldview. Tigers, porcupines, birds, and deer filled his canvases with quiet vitality, while his illustrations of goddesses—such as Bangari Devi, Bahri Batorandevi, and Chausat Joghan—brought divine feminine power into visual form in the book Gond Devlok, a collaboration with Dr. Dharmendra Pare.Narmada Prasad Tekam’s legacy lives on through the forests he painted, the deities he invoked, and the sand where it all began",

      "1. This intricate painting by renowned Gond artist Narmada Prasad Tekam depicts a divine, mythological figure rendered in his signature line-and-dot technique, a hallmark of Gond tribal art. The central figure—a deity or forest spirit—holds a bow in one hand and a flowering branch in the other, symbolizing both protection and regeneration. The rhythmic patterning of fine lines and vibrant dots creates a sense of movement and spiritual energy, reflecting the deep connection between nature, myth, and daily life in Gond cosmology. Tekam’s use of symmetry and minimal color evokes a meditative stillness while retaining the narrative richness of oral tradition.",
