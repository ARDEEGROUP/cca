       Ardee Foundation,  known for its contribution to education and philanthropy for over four decades, presents CCA (Centre for Culture and Art), a space for culture, thought and art.

         CCA was born under the guiding light of the visionary Mr. Ashok Varma in the late 80s.

CCA is envisioned as a collectors home, a space where guests engage with the ever-evolving art on the walls of the living rooms, research in its vast library and where the large sculpture gardens and amphitheatre becomes a spot for creative reflection, thought and dialogue.
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed  max-w-xl text-white"> A talent incubator since the 90s,  CCA will also continue its patronage in its studios, supporting  young and emerging artists who promise to be the future masters of India.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-[50px] max-w-xl text-white">A vibrant cultural annual programme with senior artists, curators, art historians, museum directors will offer an inspirational range of experiences and interactions which keep bringing guests back for more.</p>
